ever:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Now that <a href=\\\"http://searchengineland.com/tested-googlebot-crawls-javascript-heres-learned-220157\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">they are indexed by Google</a>\\nand thanks to awesome frontend technologies such as <a href=\\\"http://angularjs.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">AngularJS</a> or <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">React</a>,\\n<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">full-Javascript</a> <strong>webapps are becoming the standard</strong>.</li>\\n<li><a

users spend more time on their mobile devices than on desktops</a>: having a responsive website is mandatory and <strong>native mobile apps are a must-have</strong>.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">The semantic web</a> and <strong>especially <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Linked Data</a>\\nis a reality</strong>: with the <a href=\\\"http://schema.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Schema.org</a> initiative and new open web standards such as <a href=\\\"http://json-ld.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">JSON-LD</a>,\\nsearch engines (among a bunch of other services and softwares) consume structured and machine-readable data at web scale.\\nNot exposing such data decrease interoperability and search engine ranking/efficiency (think rich snippets).</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://php.net\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">PHP.net</a>, <a href=\\\"https://symfony.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Symfony</a>, <a href=\\\"http://hhvm.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Facebook</a> and many others have worked hard\\nto improve and professionalize the PHP ecosystem. The PHP world has closed the gap with most backend solutions and is often\\nmore innovative than them.</p>\\n<p>However in critical area I've described previously, many things can be improved. Almost all existing solutions are still <a href=\\\"https://symfony.com/doc/current/book/page_creation.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">designed\\nand documented</a> to create websites the old way: a server generates\\nthen sends plain-old HTML documents to browsers.</p>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://api-platform.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">API Platform</a> is a set of tools for building modern web projects. It is a framework\\nfor API-first projects built on top of Symfony. Like other modern frameworks such as Zend Framework and Symfony, it's both\\na full-stack all-in-one framework and a set of independent PHP components and bundles that can be used separately.</p>\\n<p>The architecture promoted by the framework will distrust many of you but read this tutorial until the end and you will\\nsee how API Platform make modern development easy and fun again:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/distribution/index\\\">Start by <strong>creating a hypermedia REST API</strong></a> exposing structured data that can\\nbe understood by any compliant client such your apps but also as search engines (JSON-LD with Schema.org vocabulary).\\nThis API is the central and unique entry point to access and modify data. It also encapsulates the whole business logic.</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/docs/client-generator/index\\\">Then <strong>create as many clients as you want using frontend technologies you love</strong></a>: an HTML5/Javascript\\nwebapp querying the API in AJAX (of course) but also a native iOS or Android app, or even a desktop application. Clients\\nonly display data and forms.</li>\\n</ul>\"},\"navDoc\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"title\":\"The Distribution\",\"path\":\"distribution\",\"items\":[{\"id\":\"index\",\"title\":\"Creating a

Platform</em> is the most advanced API platform, in any framework or language.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Fabien Potencier (creator of Symfony), SymfonyCon 2017</li>\\n</ul>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://api-platform.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">API Platform</a> is a powerful but easy to use <strong>full stack</strong> framework dedicated to API-driven projects.\\nIt contains a <strong>PHP</strong> library to create fully-featured APIs supporting industry-leading standards (JSON-LD, GraphQL, OpenAPI...),\\nprovides ambitious <strong>JavaScript</strong> tooling to consume those APIs in a snap (admin, PWA and mobile apps generators, hypermedia\\nclient...) and is shipped with a nice <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Kubernetes</strong> integration to develop and deploy instantly in the cloud.</p>\\n<p>The easiest and more powerful way to get started is to download the API Platform official distribution.\\nIt contains:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>an API skeleton, including with <a href=\\\"/docs/core/index\\\">the server-side component</a>, <a href=\\\"https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">the Symfony 4\\nmicroframework</a> and <a href=\\\"http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">the Doctrine ORM</a></li>\\n<li>a dynamic JavaScript admin, leveraging the hypermedia capabilities of API Platform and built on top of <a href=\\\"https://reactjs.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">React</a>\\nand <a href=\\\"https://github.com/marmelab/admin-on-rest\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Admin On Rest</a></li>\\n<li>a Progressive Web App skeleton, generated with <a

target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Docker</a>-based setup to bootstrap the project in a single command, providing:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>servers for the API and JavaScript apps</li>\\n<li>a <a href=\\\"http://varnish-cache.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Varnish Cache</a> server enabling the <a href=\\\"/docs/core/performance#enabling-the-builtin-http-cache-invalidation-system\\\">API Platform's built-in invalidation cache mechanism</a></li>\\n<li>a development HTTP/2 and HTTPS proxy (allowing, for instance, to test the provided <a href=\\\"https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">service workers</a>)</li>\\n<li>a <a href=\\\"https://helm.sh/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Helm</a> chart to deploy the API in any <a href=\\\"https://kubernetes.io/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Kubernetes</a> cluster</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>To discover how the framework works, we will create an API to manage a bookshop.</p>\\n<p>To create a fully featured API, an admin interface and a Progressive Web app, we will only have to design the public data\\nmodel of our API and handcraft it as <em>Plain Old PHP Objects</em>.</p>\\n<p>API Platform uses these model classes to expose a web API having a bunch of built-in features:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>creating, retrieving, updating and deleting (CRUD) resources</li>\\n<li>data validation</li>\\n<li>pagination</li>\\n<li>filtering</li>\\n<li>sorting</li>\\n<li>hypermedia/<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"

as the API Platform distribution includes <a href=\\\"https://symfony.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">the Symfony framework</a>,\\nit is compatible with most <a

benefits from the numerous extensions points provided by this rock-solid foundation (events, DIC...).\\nAdding features like custom, service-oriented, API endpoints, JWT or OAuth authentication, HTTP

You will add your own code and configuration inside\\nit.</p>\\n<p>API Platform is shipped with a <a href=\\\"https://docker.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Docker</a> setup that makes it easy to get a containerized development\\nenvironment up and running. If you do not already have Docker on your computer, <a href=\\\"https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">it's the right time to install it</a>.</p>\\n<p>Open a terminal, and navigate to the directory containing your project skeleton.

It will take some time, but don't worry,\\nthis is done only once. Starting servers will then be lightning fast.</p>\\n<p>To see the container's logs, run:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>$ docker-compose logs -f # follow the logs</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Project's files are automatically shared between your local host machine and the container thanks to a pre-configured <a href=\\\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Docker\\nvolume</a>. It means that you can edit files of your project locally\\nusing your preferred IDE or code editor, they will be transparently taken into account in the container.\\nSpeaking about IDEs, our favorite software to develop API Platform apps is <a href=\\\"https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">PHPStorm</a>\\nwith its awesome <a href=\\\"https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/Getting+Started+-+Symfony+Development+using+PhpStorm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Symfony</a>\\nand <a href=\\\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7622-php-inspections-ea-extended-\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Php Inspections</a> plugins. Give them a try,\\nyou'll got auto-completion for almost everything and awesome quality analysis.</p>\\n<p>The API Platform distribution comes with a dummy entity for test purpose: <code>api/src/Entity/Greeting.php</code>. We will remove\\nit later, but for now, create the related database table:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>$ docker-compose exec php bin/console doctrine:schema:create</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The <code>php</code> container is where your API app stands.

It is shipped, in the API Platform distribution.\\nDoctrine ORM is the easiest way to persist and query data in an API Platform project thanks to the bridge shipped with the\\ndistribution. It is optimized for performance and development convenience. For instance, when using Doctrine, API Platform\\nis able to automatically optimize the generated SQL queries by adding the appropriate <code>JOIN</code> clauses. It also provides a\\nlot of powerful built-in filters.\\nDoctrine ORM and its bridge support most popular RDBMS including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, Oracle and SQLite.</p>\\n<p>That being said, keep in mind that API Platform is 100% independent of the persistence system. You can use the one(s) that\\nbest suit(s) your needs (including NoSQL databases or remote web services). API Platform even supports using several persistence\\nsystems together in the same project.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"using-symfony-flex-and-composer-advanced-users\\\"><a href=\\\"#using-symfony-flex-and-composer-advanced-users\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Using Symfony Flex and Composer (advanced users)</h3>\\n<p>Alternatively, the API Platform server component can also be installed directly on a local machine.\\n<strong>This method is recommended only for advanced users that want full control over the directory structure and the installed\\ndependencies.</strong></p>\\n<p>The rest of this tutorial assumes that you have installed API Platform using the official distribution, go straight to the\\nnext section if it's your case.</p>\\n<p>API Platform has an official Symfony Flex recipe.

Try yourself by browsing to <code>http://localhost:8080/greetings</code>. If the <code>Accept</code> header\\ndoesn't contain <code>text/html</code> as the preferred format, a JSON-LD response is sent (<a href=\\\"/docs/core/content-negotiation\\\">configurable behavior</a>).</p>\\n<p>So, if you want to access the raw data, you have two alternatives:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Add the correct <code>Accept</code> header (or don't set any <code>Accept</code> header at all if you don't care about security) - preferred\\nwhen writing API clients</li>\\n<li>Add the format you want as the extension of the resource - for debug purpose only</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>For instance, go to <code>http://localhost:8080/greetings.jsonld</code> to retrieve the list of <code>Greeting</code> resources in JSON-LD, or to\\n<code>http://localhost:8080/greetings.json</code> to retrieve data in raw JSON.</p>\\n<p>Of course, you can also use your favorite HTTP client to query the API.\\nWe are fond of <a href=\\\"https://www.getpostman.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Postman</a>. It works perfectly well with API Platform, has native Open API support,\\nallows to easily write functional tests and has good team collaboration features.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"bringing-your-own-model\\\"><a href=\\\"#bringing-your-own-model\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Bringing your Own Model</h2>\\n<p>Your API Platform project is now 100% functional.

In a hypermedia API, every resource is identified by an (unique) <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">IRI</a>.\\nA URL is a valid IRI, and it's what API Platform uses. The <code>@id</code> property of every JSON-LD document contains the IRI identifying\\nit. You can use this IRI to reference this document from other documents. In the previous request, we used the IRI of the\\nbook we created earlier to link it with the <code>Review</code> we were creating. API Platform is smart enough to deal with IRIs.\\nBy the way, you may want to <a href=\\\"/docs/core/serialization\\\">embed documents</a> instead of referencing them\\n(e.g. to reduce the number of HTTP requests). You can even <a href=\\\"/docs/core/filters#property-filter\\\">let the client selecting only the properties it needs</a>.</p>\\n<p>The other interesting thing is how API Platform handles dates (the <code>publicationDate</code> property). API Platform understands\\n<a href=\\\"http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.date.php\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">any date format supported by PHP</a>.

Read <a href=\\\"/docs/core/index\\\">the full documentation</a> to discover how to use them\\nand how to extend API Platform to fit your needs.\\nAPI Platform is incredibly efficient for prototyping and Rapid Application Development (RAD). But the framework is mostly\\ndesigned to create complex API-driven projects, far beyond simple CRUD apps. It benefits from <strong>strong extension points</strong>\\nand is <strong>is continuously optimized for performance.</strong> It powers numerous high-traffic websites.</p>\\n<p>API Platform has a built-in HTTP cache invalidation system which allows to make API Platform apps blazing fast, and it uses\\n<a href=\\\"https://varnish-cache.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Varnish</a> by default. Read more in the chapter\\n<a href=\\\"/docs/core/performance#enabling-the-builtin-http-cache-invalidation-system\\\">API Platform Core Library: Enabling the Built-in HTTP Cache Invalidation System</a>.</p>\\n<p>API Platform can also be extended using PHP libraries and Symfony bundles.</p>\\n<p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of popular API Platform extensions:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/lexik/LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Secure the API with JWT</a> (LexikJwtAuthenticationBundle) or <a href=\\\"https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSOAuthServerBundle\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">OAuth</a>\\n(FosOAuthServer)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/email/email.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Send mails</a> (Swift Mailer)</li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://github.com/php-amqplib/RabbitMqBundle\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Execute async jobs and create micro-service architectures using RabbitMQ</a>\\n(RabbitMQBundle)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Keep in mind that you can use your favorite client-side technology: API Platform provides React and Vue.js components;\\nbut you can use your preferred client-side technology including Angular, Ionic and Swift.

in the <a href=\\\"https://symfony.com/doc/current/validation/severity.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Symfony documentation</a>, you can use the payload field to define error levels.\\nYou can retrieve the payload field by setting the <code>serialize_payload_fields</code> option to <code>true</code> in the API Platform config:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-yaml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># api/config/packages/api_platform.yaml</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token key

</div>\\n<p>Then, the serializer will return all payload values in the error response.</p>\\n<p>If you want to serialize only some payload fields, define them in the config like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-yaml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># api/config/packages/api_platform.yaml</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token key

the Symfony Serializer Component to transform PHP entities in (hypermedia) API responses.</p>\\n<p>The main serialization process has two stages:</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>As you can see in the picture above, an array is used as a man in the middle. This way, Encoders will only deal with turning specific formats into arrays and vice versa. The same way, Normalizers will deal with turning specific objects into arrays and vice versa.\\n-- <a href=\\\"https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/serializer.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">The Symfony documentation</a></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Unlike Symfony itself, API Platform leverages custom normalizers, its router and the <a href=\\\"/docs/core/data-providers\\\">data provider</a> system to do an advanced tranformation. Metadata are added to the generated document including links, type information, pagination data or available filters.</p>\\n<p>The API Platform Serializer is extendable, you can register custom normalizers and encoders to support other formats. You can also decorate existing normalizers to customize their behaviors.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"available-serializers\\\"><a href=\\\"#available-serializers\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Available Serializers</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://json-ld.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">JSON-LD</a> serializer\\n<code>api_platform.jsonld.normalizer.item</code></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>JSON-LD, or JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data, is a method of encoding Linked Data using JSON.

Platform components, the Serializer can be configured using annotations, XML and YAML.\\nAs annotations are easy to understand and allow to group code and configuration, we will use them in the

how you can modify the normalization/denormalization context based on the current user permissions for all the books that are being normalized/denormalized. Sometimes, however, the permissions vary depending on what book is being processed. Think of ACL's: User A may retrieve Book A but not Book B. In that case, we have to leverage the power of the Symfony Serializer and register our own normalizer that adds the group on every single item (priority <code>64</code> is just an example, make sure your normalizer gets loaded first):</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-yaml\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token comment\\\"># api/config/services.yaml</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">services</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">'App\\\\Serializer\\\\BookAttributeNormalizer'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">arguments</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">[</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'@security.token_storage'</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">]</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">tags</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span>\\n            <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">-</span> <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span> <span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">name</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token string\\\">'serializer.normalizer'</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">,</span> <span class=\\\"token key atrule\\\">priority</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> <span class=\\\"token number\\\">64 </span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The Normalizer class is a bit harder to understand because it has to make sure there's no recursion.

setter for the identifier of the entity or make it a <code>public</code> property</li>\\n<li>Add the denormalization group to the property if you use a specific denormalization group</li>\\n<li>If you

has <a href=\\\"http://blog.theamazingrando.com/in-band-vs-out-of-band.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">many advantages</a>. One of\\nthem is the ability to know exactly which resources are included in HTTP responses created by the API. We used this\\nspecificity to make API Platform apps blazing fast.</p>\\n<p>When the cache mechanism <a href=\\\"/docs/core/configuration\\\">is enabled</a>, API Platform collects identifiers of every resources\\nincluded in a given HTTP response (including lists, embedded documents and subresources) and returns them in a special\\nHTTP header called <a href=\\\"https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/206596608-How-to-Purge-Cache-Using-Cache-Tags-Enterprise-only-\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Cache-Tags</a>.</p>\\n<p>A <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accelerator\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">cache reverse proxy</a> supporting cache tags (Varnish, CloudFlare,\\nFastly…) must be put in front of the web server and store all responses returned by the API with a high\\n<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">TTL</a>. When a resource is modified, API Platform takes care of purging all\\nresponses containing it in the proxy’s cache. It means that after the first request, all subsequent requests will not\\ntouch the web server, and will be served instantly from the cache. It also means that the content served will always be\\nfresh, because the cache is purged in real time.</p>\\n<p>The support for most specific cases such as the invalidation of collections when a document is added or removed or for\\nrelationships and inverse relations is built-in.</p>\\n<p>We also included <a href=\\\"https://varnish-cache.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Varnish</a> in the <a href=\\\"/docs/deployment/docker\\\">Docker setup</a> provided with the\\ndistribution of API Platform, so this feature works out of the box.</p>\\n<p>Integration with Varnish and the Doctrine ORM is shipped with the core library.

resource and thus will set <code>useFetchJoinCollection</code> to <code>true</code> on the Doctrine Paginator class. Having this option imply that 2 sql requests will be executed (so this avoid having less results than expected).</p>\\n<p>In most cases, even without collection on the resource, this parameter has little impact on performance. However when fetching a lot of results per page it can be counter productive.</p>\\n<p>That's why this behavior can be configured with the <code>pagination_fetch_join_collection</code> parameter on a

Operations can be applied to a resource exposed by the API. From\\nan implementation point of view, an operation is a link between a resource, a route and its related controller.</p>\\n<p>API Platform automatically registers typical <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">CRUD</a> operations\\nand describes them in the exposed documentation (Hydra and Swagger). It also creates and registers routes corresponding\\nto these operations in the Symfony routing system (if it is available).</p>\\n<p>The behavior of built-in operations is briefly presented in the <a href=\\\"/docs/core/getting-started#mapping-the-entities\\\">Getting started</a>\\nguide.</p>\\n<p>The list of enabled operations can be configured on a per resource basis. Creating custom operations on specific routes\\nis also possible.</p>\\n<p>There are two types of operations: collection operations and item operations.</p>\\n<p>Collection operations act on a collection of resources. By default two routes are implemented: <code>POST</code> and <code>GET</code>. Item\\noperations act on an individual resource. 3 default routes are defined <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code> and <code>DELETE</code> (<code>PATCH</code> is also supported\\nwhen <a href=\\\"/docs/core/content-negotiation\\\">using the JSON API format</a>, as required by the specification).</p>\\n<p>When the <code>ApiPlatform\\\\Core\\\\Annotation\\\\ApiResource</code> annotation is applied to an entity class, the following built-in CRUD\\noperations are automatically enabled:</p>\\n<p><em>Collection operations</em></p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Method</th>\\n<th>Mandatory</th>\\n<th>Description</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>GET</code></td>\\n<td>yes</td>\\n<td>Retrieve the (paginated) list of elements</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>POST</code></td>\\n<td>no</td>\\n<td>Create a new element</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p><em>Item operations</em></p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Method</th>\\n<th>Mandatory</th>\\n<th>Description</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>GET</code></td>\\n<td>yes</td>\\n<td>Retrieve element</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>PUT</code></td>\\n<td>no</td>\\n<td>Update an element</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code>DELETE</code></td>\\n<td>no</td>\\n<td>Delete an element</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h2 id=\\\"enabling-and-disabling-operations\\\"><a href=\\\"#enabling-and-disabling-operations\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Enabling and Disabling Operations</h2>\\n<p>If no operation are specified, all default CRUD operations are automatically registered. It is also possible - and recommended\\nfor large projects - to define operations explicitly.</p>\\n<p>Keep in mind that <code>collectionOperations</code> and <code>itemOperations</code> behave independently. For instance, if you don't explicitly\\nconfigure operations for <code>collectionOperations</code>, <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> operations will be automatically registered, even if you\\nexplicitly configure <code>itemOperations</code>. The reverse is also true.</p>\\n<p>Operations can be configured using annotations, XML or YAML. In the following examples, we enable only the built-in operation\\nfor the <code>GET</code> method for both <code>collectionOperations</code> and <code>itemOperations</code> to create a readonly endpoint.</p>\\n<p><code>itemOperations</code> and <code>collectionOperations</code> are arrays containing a list of operation. Each operation is defined by a key\\ncorresponding to the name of the operation that can be anything you want and an array of properties as value. If an\\nempty list of operations is provided, all operations are disabled.</p>\\n<p>If the operation's name match a supported HTTP methods (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code> or <code>DELETE</code>), the corresponding <code>method</code> property\\nwill be automatically added.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-php\\\"><code><span

A subresource is a collection or an item that belongs to another resource.\\nThe starting point of a subresource must be a relation on an existing resource.</p>\\n<p>For example, let's create two entities (Question, Answer) and set up a subresource so that <code>/question/42/answer</code> gives us\\nthe answer to the question 42:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre

Such custom\\ncontrollers can be any valid <a href=\\\"http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/controller.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Symfony controller</a>, including standard\\nSymfony controllers extending the <a href=\\\"http://api.symfony.com/3.1/Symfony/Bundle/FrameworkBundle/Controller/Controller.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\"><code>Symfony\\\\Bundle\\\\FrameworkBundle\\\\Controller\\\\Controller</code></a>\\nhelper class.</p>\\n<p>However, API Platform recommends to use <strong>action classes</strong> instead of typical Symfony controllers. Internally, API Platform\\nimplements the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/pmjones/adr\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Action-Domain-Responder</a> pattern (ADR), a web-specific refinement of\\n<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">MVC</a>.</p>\\n<p>Note: <a href=\\\"/docs/core/events\\\">the event system</a> should be preferred over custom controllers when applicable.</p>\\n<p>The distribution of API Platform also eases the implementation of the ADR pattern: it automatically registers action classes\\nstored in <code>src/App/Controller</code> as autowired services.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to the <a href=\\\"http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/autowiring.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">autowiring</a> feature of the\\nSymfony Dependency Injection container, services required by an action can be type-hinted in its constructor, it will be\\nautomatically instantiated and injected, without having to declare it explicitly.</p>\\n<p>In the following examples, the built-in <code>GET</code> operation is registered as well as a custom operation called <code>special</code>.\\nThe <code>special</code> operation reference the Symfony route named <code>book_special</code>.</p>\\n<p>Note: By default, API Platform uses the first <code>GET</code> operation defined in <code>collectionOperations</code> to generate the IRI for\\na resource class.</p>\\n<p>Note: With custom operation, you will probably want to properly document it. See the <a href=\\\"/docs/core/swagger\\\">swagger</a> part of the documentation to do so.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"recommended-method\\\"><a href=\\\"#recommended-method\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Recommended Method</h3>\\n<p>First, let's create your custom operation:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-php\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token delimiter important\\\">&lt;?php</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">// api/src/Controller/BookSpecial.php</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">namespace</span> <span class=\\\"token package\\\">App<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\\</span>Controller</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">use</span> <span class=\\\"token package\\\">App<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\\</span>Entity<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">\\\\</span>Book</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">class</span> <span class=\\\"token class-name\\\">BookSpecial</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">private</span> <span class=\\\"token variable\\\">$myService</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">public</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">__construct</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>MyService <span class=\\\"token variable\\\">$myService</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token variable\\\">$this</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">-</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span><span class=\\\"token property\\\">myService</span> <span class=\\\"token operator\\\">=</span> <span class=\\\"token variable\\\">$myService</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">public</span> <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"token function\\\">__invoke</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span>Book <span class=\\\"token variable\\\">$data</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">:</span> Book\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">{</span>\\n        <span class=\\\"token variable\\\">$this</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">-</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span><span class=\\\"token property\\\">myService</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">-</span><span class=\\\"token operator\\\">></span><span class=\\\"token function\\\">doSomething</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">(</span><span class=\\\"token variable\\\">$data</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">)</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n\\n        <span class=\\\"token keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"token variable\\\">$data</span><span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">;</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token punctuation\\\">}</span>\\n</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>This custom operation behaves exactly like the built-in operation: it returns a JSON-LD document corresponding to the id\\npassed in the URL.</p>\\n<p>Here we consider that <a href=\\\"https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/autowiring.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">autowiring</a> is enabled for\\ncontroller classes (the default when using the API Platform distribution).\\nThis action will be automatically registered as a service (the service name is the same as the class name:\\n<code>App\\\\Controller\\\\BookSpecial</code>).</p>\\n<p>API Platform automatically retrieves the appropriate PHP entity using the data provider then deserializes user data in it,\\nand for <code>POST</code> and <code>PUT</code> requests updates the entity with data provided by the user.\\nBy convention, the action's parameter must be called <code>$data</code>.</p>\\n<p>Services (<code>$myService</code> here) are automatically injected thanks to the autowiring feature.

href=\\\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">RFC 7519</a>) for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims. For example, a server could generate a token that has the claim \\\"logged in as admin\\\" and provide that to a client. The client could then use that token to prove that he/she is logged in as admin. The tokens are signed by the server's key, so the server is able to verify that the token is legitimate. The tokens are designed to be compact, URL-safe and usable especially in web browser single sign-on (SSO) context.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token\\\"

with an API and therefore is an alternative to REST.</p>\\n<p>It has some advantages compared to REST: it solves the over-fetching or under-fetching of data, is strongly typed, and is capable of retrieving multiple and nested data in one time; but it also comes with drawbacks: for example it creates overhead depending of the request.</p>\\n<p>API Platform creates a REST API by default. But you can choose to enable GraphQL as well.</p>\\n<p>Once enabled, you have nothing to do: your schema describing your API is automatically built and your GraphQL endpoint is ready to go!</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"enabling-graphql\\\"><a href=\\\"#enabling-graphql\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Enabling GraphQL</h2>\\n<p>To enable GraphQL and GraphiQL interface in your API, simply require the graphql-php package using Composer:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>$ composer require webonyx/graphql-php</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>You can now use GraphQL at the endpoint: <code>http://localhost/graphql</code>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"graphiql\\\"><a href=\\\"#graphiql\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>GraphiQL</h2>\\n<p>If Twig is installed in your project, go to the GraphQL endpoint with your browser.

a new project, the easiest way to get API Platform up is to install the <a href=\\\"/docs/distribution/index\\\">API Platform Distribution</a>.\\nIt ships with the API Platform Core library integrated with <a href=\\\"https://symfony.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">the Symfony framework</a>, <a href=\\\"/docs/schema-generator/\\\">the schema

rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Behat</a>.\\nBasically, it is a Symfony edition packaged with the best tools to develop a REST API and sensible default settings.</p>\\n<p>Alternatively, you can use <a href=\\\"http://getcomposer.org\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Composer</a> to install the standalone bundle in an existing Symfony Flex\\nproject:</p>\\n<p><code>composer require api</code></p>\\n<p>There is no mandatory configuration options although <a href=\\\"/docs/core/configuration\\\">many settings are available</a>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"before-reading-this-documentation\\\"><a href=\\\"#before-reading-this-documentation\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

entities mapped as \\\"API resources\\\" through a REST API supporting CRUD\\noperations.\\nTo expose your entities, you can use Docblock annotations, XML and YAML configuration files.</p>\\n<p>Here

<code>Offer</code> entities as JSON-LD documents through an hypermedia\\nweb API.</p>\\n<p>If you are familiar with the Symfony ecosystem, you noticed that entity classes are also mapped with Doctrine ORM annotations\\nand validation constraints from <a href=\\\"http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/validation.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">the Symfony Validator Component</a>.\\nThis isn't mandatory. You can use <a href=\\\"/docs/core/data-providers\\\">your preferred persistence</a> and <a href=\\\"/docs/core/validation\\\">validation</a> systems.\\nHowever, API Platform Core has built-in support for those library and is able to use them without requiring any specific\\ncode or configuration to automatically persist and validate your data. They are good default and we encourage you to use\\nthem unless you know what you are doing.</p>\\n<p>Thanks to the mapping done previously, API Platform Core will automatically register the following REST <a href=\\\"/docs/core/operations\\\">operations</a>\\nfor resources of the product type:</p>\\n<p>Product</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>Method</th>\\n<th>URL</th>\\n<th>Description</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>GET</td>\\n<td>/products</td>\\n<td>Retrieve the (paged) collection</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>POST</td>\\n<td>/products</td>\\n<td>Create a new product</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>GET</td>\\n<td>/products/{id}</td>\\n<td>Retrieve a product</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>PUT</td>\\n<td>/products/{id}</td>\\n<td>Update a product</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>DELETE</td>\\n<td>/products/{id}</td>\\n<td>Delete a product</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>The same operations are available for the offer method (routes will start with the <code>/offers</code> pattern).\\nRoute prefixes are built by pluralizing the name of the mapped entity class.\\nIt is also possible to override the naming convention using <a href=\\\"/docs/core/operation-path-naming\\\">operation path namings</a>.</p>\\n<p>As an alternative to annotations, you can map entity classes using XML or YAML:</p>\\n<p>XML:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-xml\\\"><code><span

only supports raw documents as request input (encoded in JSON, XML, YAML...). This has many advantages including support of types and the ability to send back to the API documents originally retrieved through a <code>GET</code> request.\\nHowever, sometimes - for instance, to support legacy clients - it is necessary to accept inputs encoded in the traditional <a href=\\\"https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\"><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></a> format (HTML form content type). This can easily be done using <a href=\\\"/docs/core/events\\\">the powerful event system</a> of the framework.</p>\\n<p>In this tutorial, we will decorate the default <code>DeserializeListener</code> class to handle form data if applicable, and delegate to the built-in listener for other cases.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"create-your-deserializelistener-decorator\\\"><a href=\\\"#create-your-deserializelistener-decorator\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"anchor\\\"><svg aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\" height=\\\"16\\\" version=\\\"1.1\\\" viewBox=\\\"0 0 16 16\\\" width=\\\"16\\\"><path fill-rule=\\\"evenodd\\\" d=\\\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\\\"></path></svg></a>Create your <code>DeserializeListener</code> Decorator</h2>\\n<p>This decorator is able to denormalize posted form data to the target object.

generic system to apply filters on collections. Useful filters for the Doctrine ORM are provided\\nwith the library. You can also create custom filters that would fit your specific needs.\\nYou can also add filtering support to your custom <a href=\\\"/docs/core/data-providers\\\">data providers</a> by implementing interfaces provided\\nby the library.</p>\\n<p>By default, all filters are disabled. They must be enabled explicitly.</p>\\n<p>When a filter is enabled, it is automatically documented as a <code>hydra:search</code> property in the collection response.

registering a filter service in the <code>api/config/services.yaml</code>\\nfile and adding an attribute to your resource configuration.</p>\\n<p>The search filter supports <code>exact</code>, <code>partial</code>, <code>start</code>, <code>end</code>, and <code>word_start</code> matching strategies:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><code>partial</code> strategy uses <code>LIKE %text%</code> to search for fields that containing the text.</li>\\n<li><code>start</code> strategy uses <code>LIKE text%</code> to search for fields that starts with text.</li>\\n<li><code>end</code> strategy uses <code>LIKE %text</code> to search for fields that ends with text.</li>\\n<li><code>word_start</code> strategy uses <code>LIKE text% OR LIKE % text%</code> to search for fields that contains the word starting with <code>text</code>.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Prepend the letter <code>i</code> to the filter if you want it to be case insensitive. For example <code>ipartial</code> or <code>iexact</code>. Note that\\nthis will use the <code>LOWER</code> function and <strong>will</strong> impact performance <a href=\\\"/docs/core/performance#search-filter\\\">if there is no proper index</a>.</p>\\n<p>Case insensitivity may already be enforced at the database level depending on the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">collation</a>\\nused. If you are using MySQL, note that the commonly used <code>utf8_unicode_ci</code> collation (and its sibling <code>utf8mb4_unicode_ci</code>)\\nare already case insensitive, as indicated by the <code>_ci</code> part in their names.</p>\\n<p>In the following example, we will see how to allow the filtering of a list of e-commerce offers:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre

They are only applied to collections. If you want to deal with the DQL query generated\\nto retrieve items, or don't need to access the HTTP request, <a href=\\\"/docs/core/extensions\\\">extensions</a> are the way to go.</p>\\n<p>A Doctrine ORM filter is basically a class implementing the <code>ApiPlatform\\\\Core\\\\Bridge\\\\Doctrine\\\\Orm\\\\Filter\\\\FilterInterface</code>.\\nAPI Platform includes a convenient abstract class implementing this interface and providing utility methods: <code>ApiPlatform\\\\Core\\\\Bridge\\\\Doctrine\\\\Orm\\\\Filter\\\\AbstractFilter</code></p>\\n<p>In the following example, we create a class to filter a collection by applying a regexp to a property. The <code>REGEXP</code> DQL\\nfunction used in this example can be found in the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/beberlei/DoctrineExtensions\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\"><code>DoctrineExtensions</code></a>\\nlibrary.

The first annotation argument is the filter class, the second specifies options, here the strategy:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>@ApiFilter(SearchFilter::class, strategy=\\\"partial\\\")</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The second annotation, we specify <code>properties</code> on which the filter should apply. It's necessary here because we don't want to filter <code>colors</code> but the property <code>prop</code> of the <code>colors</code> association.\\nNote that for each given property we specify the strategy:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>@ApiFilter(SearchFilter::class, properties={\\\"colors.prop\\\": \\\"ipartial\\\"})</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The <code>ApiFilter</code> annotation can be set on the class as well.

The result is the exact same as the example with annotations on properties:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>@ApiFilter(SearchFilter::class, properties={\\\"colors.prop\\\": \\\"ipartial\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"partial\\\"})</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Note that you can specify the <code>properties</code> argument on every filter.</p>\\n<p>The next filters are not related to how the data is fetched but rather on the how the serialization is done on those, we can give an <code>arguments</code> option (<a href=\\\"#serializer-filters\\\">see here for the available arguments</a>):</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-none\\\"><code>@ApiFilter(PropertyFilter::class,

This allows you to describe JSON-LD\\ntyped values, inverse properties using the <code>@reverse</code> keyword and you can even overwrite the <code>@id</code> property this way. Everything you define\\nwithin the following annotation, will be passed to the context, that provides a generic way to extend the context.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre

Event System</h1>\\n<p>API Platform Core implements the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/pmjones/adr\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Action-Domain-Responder</a> pattern. This implementation\\nis covered in depth in the <a href=\\\"/docs/core/operations#creating-custom-operations-and-controllers\\\">Creating custom operations and controllers</a>\\nchapter.</p>\\n<p>Basically, API Platform Core execute an action class that will return an entity or a collection of entities. Then a series\\nof event listeners are executed which validate the data, persist it in database, serialize it (typically in a JSON-LD document)\\nand create an HTTP response that will be sent to the client.</p>\\n<p>To do so, API Platform Core leverages <a href=\\\"https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/events.html#kernel-events\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">events triggered by the Symfony HTTP Kernel</a>.\\nYou can also hook your own code to those events. They are handy and powerful extension points available at all points\\nof the request lifecycle.</p>\\n<p>In the following example, we will send a mail each time a new book is created using the API:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-php\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token delimiter important\\\">&lt;?php</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token comment\\\">//

A data provider using <a href=\\\"http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Doctrine\\nORM</a> to retrieve data from a database is included with the library and\\nis enabled by default. This data provider natively supports paged collections and filters. It can be used as is and fits\\nperfectly with common usages.</p>\\n<p>However, you sometime want to retrieve data from other sources such as another persistence layer, a webservice, ElasticSearch\\nor MongoDB.\\nCustom data providers can be used to do so. A project can include as many data providers as it needs. The first able to\\nretrieve data for a given resource will be used.</p>\\n<p>For a given resource, you can implement two kind of interfaces:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/api-platform/core/blob/master/src/DataProvider/CollectionDataProviderInterface.php\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\"><code>CollectionDataProviderInterface</code></a>\\nis used when fetching a collection.</li>\\n<li>the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/api-platform/core/blob/master/src/DataProvider/ItemDataProviderInterface.php\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\"><code>ItemDataProviderInterface</code></a>\\nis used when fetching items.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Both implementations can also implement a third, optional interface called\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/api-platform/core/blob/master/src/DataProvider/RestrictedDataProviderInterface.php\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">'RestrictedDataProviderInterface'</a>\\nif you want to limit their effects to a single resource or operation.</p>\\n<p>In the following examples we will create custom data providers for an entity class called <code>App\\\\Entity\\\\BlogPost</code>.\\nNote, that if your entity is not Doctrine-related, you need to flag the identifier property by using <code>@ApiProperty(identifier=true)</code> for things to work properly (see also <a href=\\\"/docs/core/serialization#entity-identifier-case\\\">Entity Identifier Case</a>).</p>\\n<h2

The core library <a href=\\\"https://github.com/api-platform/core/pull/1189\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">is being patched</a>\\nto document relations to collections through OWL.</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, it is possible to manually configure API Platform to handle relations to collections.</p>\\n<p>We will create the admin for an API exposing <code>Person</code> and <code>Book</code> resources linked with a <code>many-to-many</code>\\nrelation between them (through the <code>authors</code> property).</p>\\n<p>This API can be created using the following PHP code:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-php\\\"><code><span class=\\\"token delimiter important\\\">&lt;?php</span>\\n<span class=\\\"token

This data structure can be customized to add, remove or customize resources and properties. To do so, we can leverage the <code>AdminBuilder</code> component provided by the library. It's a lower level component than the <code>HydraAdmin</code> one we used in the previous example. It allows to access to the object storing the structure of admin's screens.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"using-custom-components\\\"><a href=\\\"#using-custom-components\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"

interface\\nfor any API supporting <a href=\\\"http://www.hydra-cg.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">the Hydra Core Vocabulary</a>, including but not limited to all APIs created\\nusing <a href=\\\"https://api-platform.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">the API Platform framework</a>.</p>\\n<p>The generated administration is a 100% standalone Single-Page-Application with no coupling to the server part, according\\nto the API-first paradigm.</p>\\n<p>API Platform Admin parses the Hydra documentation then uses the awesome <a href=\\\"https://marmelab.com/admin-on-rest/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">Admin On Rest</a>\\nlibrary (and <a href=\\\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\\\">React</a>) to expose a nice, responsive, management interface (Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete)\\nfor all available resources.</p>\\n<p>You can also customize all screens by using Admin On Rest components and even raw JavaScript/React code.</p>\\n<h2
